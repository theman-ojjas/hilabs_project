# HiLabs Hackathon 2025 ‚Äì Free-Text Roster Email Parser

## üìå Problem Statement

This project is a solution to the **HiLabs Hackathon 2025** challenge:
Parsing and standardizing **free-text roster emails** into a clean, structured **Excel output** that exactly matches the provided template.

The tool:

* Reads input emails in **`.eml` format**.
* Extracts critical roster information (Provider Name, NPI, TIN, Specialty, Effective Date, etc.).
* Fills missing values with **‚ÄúInformation not found‚Äù**.
* Outputs a standardized Excel file (`Output.xlsx`) that matches the **Output Format.xlsx** specification.

### 3. Setup Ollama & Model

This solution uses **Ollama** with a custom local model for parsing.
We used granite3.3:8b in Ollama because it offers a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency for parsing unstructured free-text emails. It runs fully locally (no third-party APIs), satisfying hackathon rules, and is well-suited for information extraction tasks like identifying provider details (NPI, TIN, dates, specialties). This makes it reliable, fast, and compliant for the roster parsing challenge.

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai).
2. Pull the base model:

   ```bash
   ollama run granite3.3:8b
   ```
3. Create the custom model alias (`mario`):

   ```bash
   ollama create mario -f Modelfile
   ```
